# Blackjack
 Play a classic game of blackjack against a computer, who plays the role of the dealer.
 
This is a simplified terminal-based version of the card game, with cards being dealt one-by-one. Simply keep asking for more cards until you feel you've amassed a high enough score to stop. But get too greedy and you'll go over 21 and lose!
 
# Rules
 - Take turns being dealt more cards
 - Random values between 1 and 11 are given
 - Try to get a high amount
 - Don't go over 21 or you lose
 - Play as many rounds as you like
 
# Features
 - Win Count (times that you trumped the dealer)
 - Lose Count (dealer won with a nigher number)
 - Greedy Count (player went over 21)
 - Draw Count (both somehow got 21)
 
# Play the game
1. First git clone the project.
2. Navigate to the project directory in console (e.g. command console) and dotnet run the script.
3. Play infinite rounds or input "stop" when prompted to quit.
4. Enjoy!
